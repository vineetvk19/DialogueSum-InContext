Dialogue Summarization with FLAN-T5
This project explores the use of in-context learning techniques to evaluate the performance of the FLAN-T5 model for dialogue summarization tasks. The goal is to determine whether the model is suitable for the task before proceeding with fine-tuning. The techniques used include direct summarization, zero-shot inference, one-shot inference, and few-shot inference.

Project Overview
The project is structured as follows:

Setup and Dependencies:

Install necessary libraries such as transformers, datasets, and evaluate.

Load the FLAN-T5 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face.

Direct Summarization:

Summarize dialogues without any prompt engineering to establish a baseline performance.

Zero-Shot Inference:

Use instruction prompts to guide the model in summarizing dialogues without any examples.

Experiment with different prompt templates to observe their impact on the model's output.

One-Shot Inference:

Provide the model with one example of a dialogue-summary pair before asking it to summarize a new dialogue.

Evaluate how the model's performance improves with a single example.

Few-Shot Inference:

Provide the model with multiple dialogue-summary pairs before asking it to summarize a new dialogue.

Analyze the impact of multiple examples on the model's summarization quality.

Generative Configuration Parameters:

Experiment with different generation parameters (e.g., temperature, top_k, top_p) to fine-tune the model's output.

Key Techniques
In-Context Learning: The model is provided with examples (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) to guide its understanding of the task.

Prompt Engineering: Different prompts are used to instruct the model on how to summarize dialogues effectively.

Model Evaluation: The model's summaries are compared against human-generated summaries to assess its performance.

Running the Notebook
Setup: Install the necessary libraries and load the FLAN-T5 model and tokenizer.

Direct Summarization: Run the cells to see how the model performs without any prompt engineering.

Zero-Shot Inference: Experiment with different prompts to guide the model's summarization.

One-Shot and Few-Shot Inference: Provide examples to the model and observe how its performance improves.

Generative Configuration: Adjust parameters like temperature, top_k, and top_p to fine-tune the model's output.

Results
The notebook demonstrates that:

Zero-shot inference improves the model's ability to summarize dialogues compared to direct summarization.

One-shot and few-shot inference further enhance the model's performance by providing it with examples.

Prompt engineering plays a crucial role in guiding the model to produce more accurate summaries.

Future Work
Fine-tune the FLAN-T5 model on a larger dataset of dialogues to improve its summarization capabilities.

Experiment with different prompt templates and generation parameters to optimize the model's output.

Explore other in-context learning techniques to further enhance the model's performance.
