# Dialogue Summarization with FLAN-T5

This project explores the use of **in-context learning techniques** to evaluate the performance of the FLAN-T5 model for dialogue summarization tasks. The goal is to determine whether the model is suitable for the task before proceeding with fine-tuning. The techniques used include **direct summarization**, **zero-shot inference**, **one-shot inference**, and **few-shot inference**.

## Project Overview

The project is structured as follows:

1. **Setup and Dependencies**: 
   - Install necessary libraries such as `transformers`, `datasets`, and `evaluate`.
   - Load the FLAN-T5 model and tokenizer from Hugging Face.

2. **Direct Summarization**:
   - Summarize dialogues without any prompt engineering to establish a baseline performance.

3. **Zero-Shot Inference**:
   - Use instruction prompts to guide the model in summarizing dialogues without any examples.
   - Experiment with different prompt templates to observe their impact on the model's output.

4. **One-Shot Inference**:
   - Provide the model with one example of a dialogue-summary pair before asking it to summarize a new dialogue.
   - Evaluate how the model's performance improves with a single example.

5. **Few-Shot Inference**:
   - Provide the model with multiple dialogue-summary pairs before asking it to summarize a new dialogue.
   - Analyze the impact of multiple examples on the model's summarization quality.

6. **Generative Configuration Parameters**:
   - Experiment with different generation parameters (e.g., `temperature`, `top_k`, `top_p`) to fine-tune the model's output.

## Key Techniques

- **In-Context Learning**: The model is provided with examples (zero-shot, one-shot, few-shot) to guide its understanding of the task.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Different prompts are used to instruct the model on how to summarize dialogues effectively.
- **Model Evaluation**: The model's summaries are compared against human-generated summaries to assess its performance.
