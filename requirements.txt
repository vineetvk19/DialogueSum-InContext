# Explanation of the Dependencies:
# transformers: Used to load the FLAN-T5 model and tokenizer.

# datasets: Used to load the DialogSum dataset.

# evaluate: Used for evaluating model performance (though not explicitly used in the notebook, it's a good practice to include it).

# rouge_score: Used for calculating ROUGE scores to evaluate summarization quality.

# peft: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning library (though not used in the notebook, it's included for future fine-tuning tasks).

# torch and torchdata: PyTorch and its data utilities, required for model inference.

# tensorflow and keras: Used for some utility functions (though not heavily used in the notebook, they are included for compatibility).
